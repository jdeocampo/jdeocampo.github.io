		"I discovered my passion for code when I was a senior in High school; it was then when it became clear what I wanted to do for a living. I pursued my career at the amazing University of the East in the Philippines where I started my major in Information Technology. During those years I took a beginner’s Web class where I discovered the love for code. Fortunately, I graduated and was included in the honors list. ",
		"I was hired by the company I had my internship. My luck seems to lose grip on me. I had a position but not into web development. After trying to justify and weigh options, I left and started the never-ending journey of becoming a web developer along with sharpening my eye for design and interactivity."
